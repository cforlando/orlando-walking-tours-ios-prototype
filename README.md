## Data
The data contained in this demo was derived from the FireBase dataset created by Keli'i Martin. It is contained in a local json file to approximate an actual NoSQL database. 

## Images
All Site images are contained in the project's Assets catalog and were collected from various sites on the web. It is not a complete collection, many of the data elements re-use the same image. 
The image assets used in this app are either pulled directly from a google image search or have been based on images found. Official assets have yet to be created by our own graphic designers. These assets should be considered "borrowed" but not licensed and should not be included in any released versions based on this work.

## Requirements
-----------
- Xcode v8.0
- Cocoapods v1.1.0

In order to install this version of Cocoapods, enter the following into your Terminal: `sudo gem install cocoapods`.

Once all that is done, you should navigate to the project directory and run `pod install`.  Make sure you open the .xcworkspace for the project.
